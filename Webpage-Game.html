                        The game is completely developed using Python Programming language.
                        Coding for the game is done in an IDE called IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning
                        Environment).
                        This is a very simple and easy to use IDE for anyone who wants to learn Python.
                        The module called Pygame is uded to devlop this game.
                        Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules which is used to create video games.
                        It consists of computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python
                        programming language.

                    My name is Madhushruti Sharma. This is my webpage. I am an Engineer by education, but by profession,
                    I am a very passionate Coding Educator /teacher and a learner. I love to teach coding and I also
                    enjoy
                    learning new programming skills. My passion drives my profession. I believe that today's kids are
                    the future
                    generation and they are going to make this world a more beautiful and better place to live in. So, I

                    very proud to teach and share my coding knowledge with the lovely and ever-curious kids, here at
                    Vedantu.
                    As the world is turning out to be a global village and everything under the sun is becoming
                    technologically driven,
                    so learning to code has become an essential skill set for the kids. Coding will not only empower
